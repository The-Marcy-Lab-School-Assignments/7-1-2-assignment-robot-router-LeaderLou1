# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones being served at `www.phones.com`. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

Using React Router, there is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:phoneId" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` extracts the value of the `phoneId` path parameter (`5`) from the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5`

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
  const { phoneId } = useParams();

  // code to render the phone details
};
```

What is the data type of `phoneId`?

# Answer

The data type is a string, url parameters in JavaScript are always treated as strings.

Not quite. You're right that `useParams` returns an object to be destructured but `phoneId` is a value inside that object. What data type is that value? The reason why we're asking is because it is often the case that you'll render a component like `PhoneDetails` for a URL like `www.phones.com/phone/5` but the `PhoneDetails` component should know which phone to show. It can use `useParams` to get that value `5` but it is important to know what data type you'll be getting that value in. Is it a number or a string (or something else)?
