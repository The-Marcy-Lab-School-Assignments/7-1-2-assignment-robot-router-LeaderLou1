# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

Paths 2 and 3 match the /products/:id path because React Router treats :id as a string and any string value will match.
