# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

`/products/5`
3 and 4 match the path because 5 is an id, and the next path is an extension of the id path
