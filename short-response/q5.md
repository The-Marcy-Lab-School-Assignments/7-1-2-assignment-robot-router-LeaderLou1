# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

Paths 2 and 3 match the /products/:id path because React Router treats :id as a string and any string value will match.

Not quite. You're right that path 3 will match but path 4 will not. In addition, path 2 will also match!

Path 2 will match because react router can't distinguish `/apple` from `/5` â€” it doesn't know that `:id` should be a number or if it could just be a fruit. Its all just strings.

Path 4 will NOT match because `/about` breaks the pattern. Extensions of the path are treated as entirely different paths. You can test this using your robot router app. Go to `http://localhost:5173/robots/2` and then go to `http://localhost:5173/robots/2/blah`. Notice how the second URL doesn't work.
